mellon - The programer's best friend
====================================

*mellon* is a documentation browser. It downloads prepared software
documentation from the internet and lets you query them for specific bits.


Running it
==========

    *WARNING*: I have no idea what I'm doing with all these npm-related stuff.
    Really, no idea. I tried my best to make it easier to run this thing, and
    I probably failed hard. Please, be patient. I promisse I'll try to work on
    this mess later, and there will probably be binaries.

* Clone this repository and enter its directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ravishi/mellon
    cd mellon
    ```

* `npm install` everything *locally*.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

* Try to run it.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
